Hi! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Robotics at MBZUAI. I received my Ph.D. in Robotics at INRIA with the DEFROST team, supervised by Dr. Gang Zheng, where I worked on the theoretical foundations of bio-inspired, continuum, and soft robots. Prior to that, I completed my master’s studies at Harvard University under the supervision of Dr. Donal Holland, founder of the Soft Robotics Toolkit, focusing on pneumatic artificial muscles for rehabilitation.

My research centers on bio-inspired and soft robotic systems, which are inherently underactuated, highly redundant, and governed by complex, history-dependent multi-physics dynamics. Methodologically, I combine physics-based modeling with data-driven robot learning, with particular emphasis on lightweight physics-informed imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-physics simulation. My work aims to integrate artificial intelligence with the mechanical intelligence embedded in soft and continuum robots, enabling robust control, perception, and planning in uncertain and unstructured environments.

I develop hybrid soft–rigid robotic systems, physics-formed expert demonstrations, diffusion-based learning from demonstrations, and real-time multi-physics simulation frameworks that capture continuum dynamics, frictional and magnetic fields, fluid–structure interactions, and actuator–robot coupling. Ultimately, my research seeks to unify physics-based and data-driven approaches to advance robotic autonomy and enable impactful real-world applications.

I have published nearly 40 papers in leading robotics journals and conferences, including IEEE T-Mech, RA-L, SMC-S, MMT, IJMS, Soft Robotics, JMR, RAS, IROS, and RoboSoft. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for soft robotics at ICRA 2025 and ICRA 2026.

I am actively looking for highly motivated PhD students, Master’s students, and research interns. All stipends are tax-free. If you are interested in working with me on soft robotics, continuum systems, physics-informed robot learning, or multi-physics simulation, please feel free to contact me at **YOUR_EMAIL@mbzuai.ac.ae**.

Here are some suggestions for preparing the email:

- Please use the subject line: **“RA/Master/PhD Prospective Student – YourName”**  
- Highlight your publications (if applicable), GPA/ranking, TOEFL/IELTS scores  
- Attach your **CV** and transcripts
