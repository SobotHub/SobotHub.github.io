Hi! 👋 I am a **Visiting Assistant Professor of Robotics at MBZUAI**. I received my **Ph.D. in Robotics from INRIA (Lille, France)** with the DEFROST team, supervised by *Dr. Gang Zheng*, where I worked on the theoretical foundations of **bio-inspired, continuum, and soft robots**. Prior to that, I obtained an **M.E. in Mechanical Engineering from University College Dublin, Ireland**, and an **M.E. and B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from Chongqing University, China**. During my master’s research, I worked under the supervision of *Dr. Donal Holland*—founder of the Soft Robotics Toolkit at Harvard—focusing on pneumatic artificial muscles for rehabilitation.

My research centers on **bio-inspired and soft robotic systems**, which are inherently underactuated, highly redundant, and governed by complex, history-dependent multi-physics dynamics. Methodologically, I combine **physics-based modeling** with **data-driven robot learning**, with particular emphasis on:  
- ⚙️ *lightweight physics-informed imitation learning*  
- 🤖 *reinforcement learning for soft/continuum systems*  
- 🌐 *real-time multi-physics simulation*  

My goal is to integrate **artificial intelligence** with the **mechanical intelligence** embodied in soft and continuum robots, enabling robust control, perception, and planning in uncertain and unstructured environments.

I develop hybrid soft–rigid robotic systems, physics-formed expert demonstrations, diffusion-based learning from demonstrations, and training-friendly multi-physics simulation frameworks that model **continuum dynamics**, **frictional and magnetic fields**, **fluid–structure interactions**, and **actuator–robot coupling**. Ultimately, my work aims to unify *physics-based* and *data-driven* approaches to advance robotic autonomy and enable transformative real-world applications.

I have published **nearly 40 papers** in leading robotics journals and conferences, including *IEEE T-Mech, RA-L, SMC-S, Soft Robotics, JMR, RAS, MMT, IJMS, IROS,* and *RoboSoft*. I also serve as an **Associate Editor for soft robotics at ICRA 2025 and ICRA 2026**.
