Hey, I am Ke Wu, an assistant professor in Robotics Department at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a>. Building on classical robotics, my research primarily explores the fundamentals of shape-shifting robotic systems, including soft robots, continuum robots, and compliant mechanisms. My work focuses on their design, modeling, structure optimization, and control. Specifically, I am interested in the mathematical principles underlying these research areas:

- Differential and algerbraic equations for modeling shape-shifting robotic systems in complex multi-physics scenarios.
  - How to derive the model using differential and algerbraic equations?
  - How to reduce the complexity of the model?
  - How to solve the model in a more efficient way?
- Modern optimization strategies for designing and optimizing shape-shifting robotic systems.
  - How to transform structure design problems into optimiztion problems?
  - How to maximize the benefits of human intuitives and bio-insipration in this design process?
- Controller design for manipulating shape-shifting robotic systems.
  - How to develop real-time model-based controllers?
  - How to develop model-free controllers?

In addition to being driven by research interests, my work is primarily aimed at addressing cutting-edge industry needs. The goal is to translate academic findings into practical applications that ultimately benefit and positively impact society.
