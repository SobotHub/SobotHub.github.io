Hi! 👋 I am a **Assistant Professor of Robotics (non-tenure-track) at MBZUAI**. I received my **Ph.D. in Robotics from INRIA (Lille, France)** with the DEFROST team, supervised by *Dr. Gang Zheng*, where I worked on the theoretical foundations of **bio-inspired, continuum, and soft robots**. Prior to that. During my master’s research, I worked under the supervision of *Dr. Donal Holland* founder of the Soft Robotics Toolkit at Harvard focusing on pneumatic artificial muscles for rehabilitation.

My research centers on **bio-inspired and soft robotic systems**, which are inherently underactuated, highly redundant, and governed by complex, history-dependent multi-physics dynamics. Methodologically, I combine **physics-based modeling** with **data-driven robot learning**, with particular emphasis on:  
- ⚙️ *Lightweight physics-informed imitation learning*  
- 🤖 *Reinforcement learning for soft/continuum systems*  
- 🌐 *Real-time multi-physics simulation*  

My goal is to integrate **artificial intelligence** with the **mechanical intelligence** embodied in soft and continuum robots, enabling robust control, perception, and planning in uncertain and unstructured environments.

I develop soft robotic systems, physics-formed expert demonstrations, diffusion-based learning from demonstrations, and training-friendly multi-physics simulation frameworks that model **continuum dynamics**, **frictional and magnetic fields**, **fluid–structure interactions**, and **actuator–robot coupling**. Ultimately, my work aims to unify *physics-based* and *data-driven* approaches to advance robotic autonomy and enable transformative real-world applications.

I have published in leading robotics journals and conferences, including *IEEE T-Mech, RA-L, SMC-S, Soft Robotics, JMR, RAS, MMT, IJMS, IROS,* and *RoboSoft*. I also serve as an **Associate Editor for soft robotics at ICRA 2025 and ICRA 2026**.

### 🧪 *Ke Wu’s Lab at MBZUAI*

My group focuses on advancing **bio-inspired robotics**, **soft–rigid hybrid systems**, **continuum robot intelligence**, and **physics-informed robot learning**. We aim to unify *mechanical intelligence* with *artificial intelligence* to enable robust, adaptive robotic behavior in complex real-world environments.

I am fortunate to supervise an outstanding group of researchers at MBZUAI.  
To date, I have supervised **17 researchers**, including PhD students, Master's students, and visiting researchers.

**PhD Students:**  
Hang Yang, Zhenye Luo, Yangming Zhang  

**Master’s Students:**  
Ibrahim Alsarraj, Nakul Vijay Nibe, Ramy Kachwaa, Marwah Suhai, Merium Fazal Abbasi,  
Kevin Henry, Salamah Almazrouei, Haobo Yang, Amal Saqib  

**Visiting Researchers:**  
Ashenafi Abrham Kassa, Fangju Yang, Qidi Sun, Tongshun Chen, Yuhao Wang  

Our lab welcomes students who are excited about **soft robotics**, **continuum mechanics**, **robot learning**, and **multi-physics simulation**—from fundamental theory to real-world experimental systems.
