Hey, I am Ke Wu, an assistant professor in Robotics Department at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a>. Building on classical robotics, my research primarily explores the fundamentals of deformable robotic systems (soft robots, continuum robots, compliant mechanisms and more), including their design, modeling, structure optimization, and control. Specifically, I am interested in the mathematical principles underlying these research areas:

- Differential and algebraic equations for modeling deformable robotic systems in complex multi-physics scenarios.
  - How to derive the model using differential and algebraic equations?
  - How to reduce the complexity of the model?
  - How to solve the model in a more efficient way?
- Modern optimization strategies for designing and optimizing deformable robotic systems.
  - How to transform structure design problems into optimiztion problems?
  - How to maximize the benefits of human intuitives and bio-insipration in this design process?
- Controller design for manipulating deformable robotic systems.
  - How to develop real-time model-based controllers?
  - How to develop model-free controllers?

In addition to being driven by research interests, my work is primarily aimed at addressing cutting-edge industry needs. The goal is to translate academic findings into practical applications that ultimately benefit and positively impact society. I am open to both academic and industrial collaborations.
