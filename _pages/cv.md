As a Master's student, I started my research journey on the research topic of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) for Rehabilitation under the supervision of Dr. Donal Holland who is the founder of the famous <a href="https://softroboticstoolkit.com/">Soft Robotics Toolkit</a> at Harvard. In the meanwhile, along with Dr. Hao, I worked on my second Master's project (Nano compliante positioning stages) in CoMAR group at UCC. Then, in 2019, I joined DEFROST at INRIA as a PhD candidate, switched to work on the theoretical studies on deformable robotic systems, including design, modeling and control of soft robots, continuun robots, compliant mechanisms and so on.
