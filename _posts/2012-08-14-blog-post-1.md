We recently submitted our paper **“Lightweight Learning from Actuation-Space Demonstrations via Flow Matching for Whole-Body Soft Robotic Grasping”** to *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)*. In this work, we show that a **Rectified Flow–based policy learned directly in actuation space** can achieve **97.5% grasp success** with only **30 demonstrations**, while generalizing across the workspace and to object size and speed variations—by leveraging the **embodied mechanical intelligence** of a soft spiral robot (SpiRob).
